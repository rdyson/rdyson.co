# Howdy! Hello World. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ¤“ 

## Week 1 - Starting June 17, 2018 

Thanks for helping me out with my goals. You're awesome. To start, I've donated $5 to your chosen organization or charity.

Here are the details, in case you're curious. I have two big goals to hit by the end of 2018: 

1. Turn into a really awesome startup developer, and 
2. Get in really good shape. 

I'm dividing the rest of the year into 3 chunks of 9 weeks, with the last week of December off.

Turning into a really awesome startup developer means getting much better at JavaScript and a JavaScript library called React (my current expertise is in older technologies), getting great at design (user experience and interfaces for websites and apps), and getting better at the business aspects of running a startup. For each of these areas I have online courses and coaching mapped out, and will be reinforcing my learning with projects. The rough outline for the first chunk on 9 weeks, where I'll be focusing on improving my programming skills, is as follows:

Chunk 1 â€” JavaScript and React (9 weeks, starting now)

* Week 1: ES6 and JS 30 / Set up website at robdyson.co (this site, improved)
* Week 2: Node / Decide on projects
* Week 3: React / Project 1
* Week 4: Advanced React / Project 1
* Week 5: Advanced React / Project 2
* Week 6: GraphQL / Project 2
* Week 7, 8, 9: Project 3 (The Big Kahuna)

Chunk 2 â€” Design UX/UI

Chunk 3 â€”Â Startup business

As for my goal of getting in really good shape, I'm working with a personal trainer to develop exercise and nutrition goals. At a high level, I want to exercise 4x/week and get down to 170 lbs from my current 185 lbs in the next 9 weeks (about 1.5 lbs/week). The goal for Week 1 is to exercise 4 times. I'll have specific goals for Week 2.

Each Sunday, I'll update you (and this page) with my progress. If I miss a goal, I'll donate another $5.

Thanks again for your help! If you have any feedback or advice, I'm more than open to it. And if you have anything you want help with, please let me know. I'd love to help.
