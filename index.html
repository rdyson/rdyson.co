# *Howdy! Hello World.* 🇬🇧 🤓 

Thanks for helping me out with my goals. You're awesome. To start, I've donated $5 to your chosen organization or charity<sup>1</sup>. If I miss a weekly goal, I'll donate another $5.

* Participants: **32**
* Donated so far: **$142.02** <sup>2</sup>
* Goals missed: **1**

## Week 8
## Starting August 6, 2018

* 4 workouts — no change in weight, but hoping to see a difference this week
* Project 3 not complete

Week 8 goals to do:

* Project 3 — No change to previous description.

#### Some more details:

I didn't plan this project out at all, and ended up mid-week without having put any effort into it. Some other things came up that took priority. As a result, I have made no meaningful progress. Donations in progress.

This week I'll get it done come hell or high water. It seems like this phrase is a little lop-sided. I'm guessing high water is a flood, but isn't that always a lot less awful than hell?

Welcome JB to the fold!

***

## Week 7
## Starting July 30, 2018

So, [Sacha Baron Cohen](https://sho.com/who-is-america) is back. And I hit my goals.

* 4 workouts, increasing weight with each workout
* Project 2 complete — I wrote a script that lets me send a text message to a bunch of people at once without sending to a group. If you're reading this, you probably got a message sent using the script. It's on [Github](https://github.com/rdyson/bulk-macos-messages) in case you're interested.

Week 7 goals to do:

* Project 3 — Search Yelp reviews for a keyword, like 'vegan'. I like going to restaurants that have vegan options, but that aren't fully vegan, so I can go with omnivores and not get mauled. People with dietary restrictions might find this useful, too.
* Reduce carbohydrate intake

#### Some more details:

The project I built this past week didn't end up reinforcing any of the specific learning I've been doing, but it was a good exercise nonetheless. I could potentially turn what I built into a web or iOS app down the road.

The project I'm working on this week will include a lot of what I've been learning, including React and perhaps GraphQL.

As for the workouts, they're going very well. I'm getting stronger each week, but I'm not dropping any weight. Last week I reduced my calorie intake by 20%. This week I'm going to be eating a diet with less carbohydrates and alcohol to see if I can shed a few pounds.


***

## Week 6
## Starting July 23, 2018

Oh, hey. Week 5 goals done:

* 4 workouts and following revised nutrition plan
* [GraphQL](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react)

Week 6 goals to do:

* Project 2 — text a bunch of people at once, but not in a group message

#### Some more details:

The course I was going to be taking this week isn't ready yet, so I'm moving project 2 to this week.

For project 2 I'm going to build a tool to send a separate text message to multiple people from my phone number. What? When I text those of you on the Rob bandwagon each week, I don't want to send a group message—so I text each of you individually. There are third-party services that let you do this without having to manually create each message, but the message won't come from me, it'll come from a random number. I'm going to try to solve this problem.

As for the exercising stuff, it's going pretty well. I've reduced my calorie intake by 20%, so we'll see if that translates to any weight loss. So far my weight has not changed since week 1, but I have been eating a lot more and exercising, so that's a positive. Mmm spaghetti. I did slack on the workout schedule this week and ended up doing two on Sunday. Not going to do that again.

Thank you very much for the encouragement, especially TM, AF, JS, JD, LD.

## Week 5
## Starting July 16, 2018

Howdy, hello. Week 4 goals done:

* [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com)
* [Level 2 React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react)
* Hit nutrition goals daily, sort of

Week 5 goals to do:

* [GraphQL](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react)
* Hit revised nutrition goals daily

#### Some more details:

I was finding the nutrition goals I'd set up pretty difficult to hit because the calorie intake required was much higher than I'm used to eating (2400 cals/day). So I've revised my daily intake to 2000 cals/day, which is much more manageable. Along with that comes revised protein and fiber goals. I'm able to do more in my gym workouts (4x/wk) and *gasp* might actually be enjoying it.

As for development, I finished the [Level 2 React course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react), which was more about reinforcing my initial learning. There is another advanced react course on its way from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com), so I'm shuffling the weekly goals a bit. This week (Week 5) will be the [GraphQL course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react), and hopefully Week 6 will be the new course, but we'll see when it's released. I've also done away with Projects 2 and 3, as it's not feasible to get anything meaningful done and still hit my other goals. I don't count this as a miss, just as deferring to weeks 7, 8, 9 for projects.

***

## Week 4
## Starting July 9, 2018

I hope you have a fantastic week. Thanks to the new people who joined the crusade last week: MW, KW and DN. Yes, it's a crusade.

Week 3 goals done:

* [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com)
* Build Project 1: Instagram post helper
* Full steam ahead on exercise and nutrition plan

Week 4 goals to do:

* [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com)
* [Level 2 React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react)
* Hit nutrition goals daily

#### Some quick details:

The exercises are getting easier, but the nutrition is proving challenging. Thanks JS for your help with this. With more meal prep I should be able to hit the nutrition goals, which are calories, fiber, and protein.

The code course I did in Week 3 (React for Beginners) was fantastic. I'm getting into some of the more challenging topics, and more of the material is applicable in real-life applications including my day job.

For my project this week I built a little tool that takes whatever text you specify and adds it to a random image, sized for sharing on Instagram. I've started a "today I learned" account where I'll share random stuff that I've discovered. Some obvious, some not. In case you're interested, the project is on [Github](https://github.com/rdyson/quick-text-image) and the Instagram account is [@todayroblearned](https://instagram.com/todayroblearned).

## Week 3
## Starting July 2, 2018

I hope you had an awesome week and weekend. I managed to get my Week 2 goals done, but again, cutting it pretty close. Thanks for the support! 

Week 2 goals done:

* Node course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com))
* Start exercise plan (4x/week) and nutrition plan
* Map out projects for coming weeks, to reinforce programming learning

Week 3 goals to do:

* [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com)
* Build Project 1: Instagram post helper
* Full steam ahead on exercise and nutrition plan

#### Some more details, about exercise:

This past week I hit the goal of exercising 4x by doing all the exercises in the Devlifts plan I've described previously. I counted this past week as sort of a warm-up week—I wanted to see if I could actually *do* the exercises, and figure out what equipment does what at the gym, who to avoid, who the nice kids are, etc. Turns out the exercises are all simple despite their dinosaur-sounding names. I'm rather sore. Big thanks to JS for your coaching!

As for the nutrition part, I tried one version of the nutrition plan that was slightly more challenging, and have decided to go the easier route, at least for now. The challenging part would have involved some keto, which is very limiting for us vegan folk. So I'm doing a (still challenging) macro nutrition plan.

If you're interested in seeing the plan, message me and I'll send it over.


#### and development 

I made the same mistake in Week 2 as I did in Week 1. I totaled all the course video times and assumed it would take me about that long to complete the goal, but I ended up taking twice as long—working out issues and reviewing (and re-reviewing) some of the more challenging concepts. The course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com)) was really great. Fast-paced like the first one, and I ended up with a usable app that lets you find and rate restaurants in your area. I may use this as a start to one of my future projects. I'm thinking about putting together a site that pulls listings in from Yelp and filters by vegan *and* non-vegan friendliness—so, a restaurant where carnivores and herbivores will be equally happy.


#### and the Week 3 project - Instagram post helper

For my project this week I'm going to build a tool that automates parts or all of the process of posting text to Instagram. I'm starting an account to post the 'today I learned' things. Random stuff I didn't know that I learn each day (you'll get a follow request soon enough). Some things will be interesting, others will be things everyone else knew already. The idea is I'd like to be able to type in "Today I learned: Lemmings actually don't kill themselves, Disney does." ([true story](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56)) and hit 'post'. I'd automatically pull in a background, lay out the text, and perhaps add a link in the comments to more information. That's the idea—I'll see how far I can get based on what Instagram allows.

## Week 2
## Starting June 25, 2018

One week down, 8 to go in Chunk 1. I cut it pretty close to the deadline, but managed to finish everything by the end of the week. I had estimated it would take approximately 15 hours to get through the two courses for Week 1, based on the duration of the videos in the courses. I had not anticipated spending quite a bit more time on a few videos involving the more complicated topics. Rookie/Week 1 mistake.

Week 1 goals done:

* Core JavaScript courses (ES6)
  * [Javascript 30](http://javascript30.com)
  * [ES6 for Everyone](http://es6.io)
* Set up website at rdyson.co, tweak
* Exercise 4x
* Plan Week 2 exercise goals

Week 2 goals to do:

* Node course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com))
* Start exercise plan (4x/week) and nutrition plan
* Map out projects for coming weeks, to reinforce programming learning

#### Some more details, about exercise:

I've signed up for [Devlifts](https://devlifts.io)—they put together health and fitness plans for...developers. You tell them your goals and go through a questionnaire, and they get back to you with a detailed exercise plan and a recommended nutrition plan. My plan consists of 4 weight-lifting days and light cardio days, targets for fiber, protein, and carbohydrates, and supplements. Check them out if this sounds good to you, and you're a developer.

#### and development:

I decided on these JavaScript courses after listening to a development podcast called [Syntax](http://syntax.fm) (thanks AF for the recommendation). The podcast is hosted by two developers who have created online courses about JavaScript and various other topics. Initially I was skeptical about the quality of the courses—some are free, others are included in a very low monthly subscription price. I was convinced after listening to most of the Syntax back catalog that these guys know what they're talking about, and have both built their businesses on referrals. I'm really impressed with the quality of the course content, and enjoy the teaching style—fast-paced short (10-20 minute) videos illustrating concepts with examples. Anything especially complex is broken down into 2-3 videos. Check them out if you're interested in learning or brushing up on anything JavaScript-related. The hosts of the show are [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com) and Scott Tolinski who has courses at [Level Up Tutorials](http://leveluptutorials.com).

## Week 1
## Starting June 18, 2018 

Here are the details, in case you're curious. I have two big goals to hit by the end of 2018: 

1. Become a much better software developer, and 
2. Get in really good shape. 

I'm dividing the rest of the year into 3 chunks of 9 weeks, with the last week of December off.

Becoming a much better software developer means getting awesome at JavaScript and a JavaScript library called React (my current expertise is in older technologies), getting great at design (user experience and interfaces for websites and apps), and getting much more familiar with the business aspects of running a startup. For each of these areas I have online courses and coaching mapped out, and will be reinforcing my learning with projects that I will share. The rough outline for the first chunk of 9 weeks, where I'll be focusing on improving my programming skills, is as follows:

Chunk 1 — JavaScript and React (9 weeks, starting June 18 and ending August 19)

* Week 1: Core JavaScript / Set up website at rdyson.co (this site, improved)
* Week 2: Node / Map out projects
* Week 3: React / Project 1
* Week 4: Advanced React / Project 1
* Week 5: Advanced React / Project 2
* Week 6: GraphQL / Project 3
* Weeks 7, 8, 9: Project 4 (The Big Kahuna)

Chunk 2 — Design UX/UI (9 weeks, starting August 20 and ending October 21)

Chunk 3 — Startup business skills (9 weeks, starting October 22 and ending December 23)

As for my goal of getting in really good shape, I'm working with a trainer to develop specific exercise and nutrition goals. At a high level, I want to exercise 4x/week and get down to 170 lbs from my current 185 lbs in the next 9 weeks (about 1.5 lbs/week). The goal for Week 1 is to exercise 4 times and to eat no fries (the hardest part of this entire mission). I'll have more specific goals for Week 2.

Each Monday I'll update you (and this page) with my progress. If I miss a goal I'll donate another $5.

Thank you again for your help! If you have any feedback or advice, I'm more than open to it. And if you have anything you want help with, please let me know. I'd love to give you a hand.

Rob

1. Some of the charities require a minimum donation greater than $5. I'll let each of you know individually about your donation.
2. Why is this number not participants*5? There are a few reasons. 1) As described above, some charities have a minimum donation greater than $5. 2) A couple of the charities are in the UK, so I donated 5 GBP. 3) Some people haven't specified an organization yet.
