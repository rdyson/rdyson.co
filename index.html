# *Howdy! Hello World.* 🇬🇧 🤓 

Thanks for helping me out with my goals. You're awesome. If you're new here, you can scroll down here to see what happened in the first rounds of this experiment. If I miss any of my goals, I'll donate $5 for each one of you to [New Story](https://newstorycharity.org).

Oh and why I'm doing this: I want to figure out what to do for the rest of my life ~~become a much better web developer, and get in decent shape~~. Easy, right? I've found that telling people what I'm up to helps out a lot.

How did the last round go?

* Goals missed: 2
* Weeks complete in this chunk (my fancy measure of time): 6/6
* Participants: 38
* Donated so far: $380

***

## Chunk 3 Done!

Thank you very much for your support. I've landed a contract that, so far, is what I've been looking for. The [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction) and the [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) career guides were both really helpful, and I'd recommend them if you're looking to (re)evaluate your own career.

That's it for now, I'll be back when I've got some new goals to hit. If you want to talk about any of this stuff, I'd love to help. Cheers!

***

## Chunk 3 - Week 6
## Starting March 25, 2019

Week 5 goals completed:

* Make a big ol' list
* Narrow down to top 5 opportunities
* 5 workouts (miss)
* Set up site for sharing notes at https://notes.rdyson.dev

Week 6 goals to do:

* Get offers
* 5 workouts
* Set up backup work
* Read ["The Great Mental Models"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=nodl_) by Shane Parrish of Farnam Street

#### Some more details:

I've narrowed down my list of jobs to 7. I'm waiting to start the interview process for 6 of them, and hoping to make good progress this week. I missed my exercise goal so I've donated to New Story. I'm planning on reading Farnam Street's new book [The Great Mental Models](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Mental-Models-Thinking-Concepts-ebook/dp/B07P79P8ST/ref=nodl_). If you haven't checked out the Farnam Street [blog](https://fs.blog/blog) or their [podcast](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project), do! It's good stuff.

In case these offers take a while or nothing pans out, I'm setting up some backup freelance work so that I can keep hunting without worrying too much about money.

I set up a site for my notes, sort of as a little side project. It's mainly for me, but there may be stuff that's of interest to you. I've been taking notes for years on various things, mainly books and articles, and now I can easily have them accessible via the web. The site is at https://notes.rdyson.dev

Thanks for reading!

## Chunk 3 - Week 5
## Starting March 18, 2019

Week 4 goals completed:

* Make a big ol' list of jobs
* 5 workouts

Week 5 goals to do:

* Make that big ol' list bigger
* Narrow down to top 5 opportunities
* 5 workouts

#### Some more details:

I've got a list of jobs, with various criteria based on what I came up with a few weeks ago. These jobs are mostly software engineering and CTO positions. I'm prioritizing those jobs in Miami or remote, both at startups and at larger companies. I'm excited about what I've found so far and will share more in the next couple of weeks.

Thank you for your support!

## Chunk 3 - Week 4
## Starting March 11, 2019

Week 3 goals completed:

* Synthesize results of [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction) and [Wait But Why]( https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) exercises
* Read [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515) by Cal Newport
* Read [Doing Good Better](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=do+good+better&qid=1552352091&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by William MacAskill
* 5 workouts, max 5 alcoholic beverages

Week 4 goals to do:

* Assemble spreadsheet of all options under consideration
* 5 workouts, max 5 alcoholic beverages
* That's it

#### Some more details:

As I mentioned last week, this whole idea of 'social impact' is something I hadn't previously considered very strongly when making decisions about work, but now I'm all in. Effective altruism, as described in William MacAskill's book [Doing Good Better](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Altruism/dp/1592409660/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=do+good+better&qid=1552352091&s=gateway&sr=8-1) makes a lot of sense to me. [Here's an explanation](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/).

[Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515) by Cal Newport was really good, lots of interesting points around connection versus conversation. If I'm with you and I'm looking at my phone, you have permission to 'ahem' in my direction. And yes the scroll free thing is happening, update later.

I've got a list of job titles, now I'm putting together actual openings and starting to talk to folks. The goal is to have my next position lined up by the end of week 6. Thanks for the support!

## Chunk 3 - Week 3
## Starting March 4, 2019

Week 2 goals completed:

* Finished [Solve for Happy](https://www.amazon.com/Solve-Happy-Engineer-Your-Path/dp/1501157558) by Mo Gawdat
* 5 workouts, 5 or less brewskis
* Finished dev project, <a href="https://hair.dog" target="_blank">hair.dog</a>

Week 3 goals to do:

* Synthesize results of [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction) and [Wait But Why]( https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html) exercises, output is a list of career options to start exploring next week (week 4)
* Read [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515) by Cal Newport
* 5 workouts, max 5 alcoholic beverages

#### Some more details:

The [80,000 Hours career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction) is fantastic. One of the priorities of the 80,000 Hours organization is to help individuals increase their social impact by determining if the best path is to find a career that has high impact or whether to donate a portion of their income. I hadn't really considered 'impact' as a priority in deciding my next move, but now I certainly am.

I put together a little website at <a href="https://hair.dog">hair.dog</a> — it's a hangover calculator of sorts, though not hugely useful because there just isn't much published data out there about hangovers. Career option? The main purpose behind doing this project was to do a bit of React programming. You can see the source <a href="https://github.com/rdyson/hair.dog" target="_blank">here</a>.

[Solve for Happy](https://www.amazon.com/Solve-Happy-Engineer-Your-Path/dp/1501157558) by Mo Gawdat was alright. I didn't get too much from it, but perhaps you might. He takes a very analytical approach to getting the most happiness out of everything. Most of it is pretty obvious (at least to me). His general advice is that it's all about perspective—you can take any situation and decide whether you're going to be happy about it or not. That's not an oversimplification of the book, in my opinion.

See you next week!

## Chunk 3 - Week 2
## Starting Feb 25, 2019

Week 1 goals completed:

* Worked through [Wait But Why career exercise]( https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)
* Finished [Flow]( https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550535462&sr=8-1&keywords=flow+mihaly+csikszentmihalyi) by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
* 5 workouts
* Planned dev project, Hair of the Dog

Week 1 goal missed:

* Max 5 alcoholic beverages 🙄

Week 2 goals to do:

* Work through [80,000 Hours career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/introduction)
* Read [Solve for Happy](https://www.amazon.com/Solve-Happy-Engineer-Your-Path/dp/1501157558) by Mo Gawdat
* 5 workouts, max 5 alcoholic beverages
* Build Hair of the Dog web app
* Elaborate on [Wait But Why career exercise](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

#### Some more details:

* [Flow]( https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550535462&sr=8-1&keywords=flow+mihaly+csikszentmihalyi) presents a lot of data about the benefits of flow (which is described as the mental state of being completely immersed in an activity) and the different areas in which it is valuable, but doesn’t really talk about getting in to a flow state. For that, I’d recommend [Deep Work]( https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=deep+work+cal+newport&qid=1551193494&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by Cal Newport.
* I did 5 workouts, but had more than 5 dranks. I blame KF for having a birthday, and AC and TM for being exceptional beverage buddies. I’ve donated $190 to New Story, $5 for each of you. Doh.
* The dev project I’m doing is a little web app I’m calling Hair of the Dog. "Ugh I’m not drinking again" comes up in group chats a little too often after a night out. I’ve said this, and inevitably gone and done it again a few weeks later. To be clear, I don’t think I have a drinking problem, but I would like to have a little more motivation to have one or two drinks and call it a night. So I’m working on a calculator that estimates the benefits/costs of that additional drink both in terms of time and money, short term and long term. I’ll share it next week.

I finished the [Wait But Why career exercise]( https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html), and it was extremely valuable. The idea is, you figure out all of the stuff you think you want from a job/profession/career, and break each one down until you know whether it’s worth including in your criteria or not. The author calls this list your list of ‘yearnings’. The opposite of a yearning is a fear.

For example, you might decide that you want a career that has you speaking in front of a lot of people and making a name for yourself in the field you’ve been in since college. Or you might decide that you really value leaving a lasting impact in your community, make a certain amount of money each year, or be regarded as highly intelligent in your friend group. Then, assess each item and figure out where it comes from—is it really you who wants it or is it an idea that you’ve thought was yours but actually comes from your friends, family, society in general? Once you have a list, you break it down by priority: non-negotiable, high, medium, and low priority. Then start matching it to the changes you need to make.

I took this process and expanded it to encompass not just career choices but life choices in general. It wasn’t comfortable, but it turned out to be incredibly valuable. I’d be happy to share my list with you individually if you’re interested—just let me know.

Thanks for reading! See you next week.

## Chunk 3 - Week 1
## Starting Feb 18, 2019

Hello blogness, my old friend. Welcome new folks! Thanks for being awesome: ND, MR, TM. Over the next 6-ish weeks I’ll be planning out my next career move, and writing about it here.

#### The short of it

I want to be very deliberate about the work I start doing next, which means thinking about the big picture—what do I want to be doing for the next 5, 10, 20 years, and how does that fit into my life as a whole? Yes 20, I’m not that old yet. I’ve had the good fortune of working with fantastic people at awesome companies, and now have a little bit of flexibility to think about what’s next. This might sound a bit hippie dippie to some of you, but I think it’s going to be an extremely valuable exercise for me personally. If you’ve been through a process like this yourself, I’d love to hear about it.

#### The long of it

So what are you talking about, Rob? Well, I’m pretty sure I want to keep doing something tech-related, but in what capacity? I’m considering starting my own company, joining a startup, or getting a more typical 9-5. Before any of that, I need to figure out what’s going to make me happy.

Weeks 1-3 are for thinking through what my typical day, month, and year are going to look like, considering not just the actual work itself, but also considering financial, social, personal and moral aspects. The output of this will be a set of criteria for my ideal work situation, as well as potentially some priorities for other parts of my life. Like, get a dog.

Weeks 3-6 are for setting up that ideal work situation to the best of my ability. This could be getting a more ‘normal’ job for a few years to save up to do x, or it could be doing x now, or it could be getting that job as a bag boy at Publix that I didn’t get at 15 (just kidding Mum). I’ll be bugging some or all of you for feedback on what I’ve come up with, just to make sure I’m not completely delusional.

Phew. If you read through all of that, I owe you a drink.

#### What am I doing this week?

* Working through the [Wait But Why career exercise](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html).
* Finish [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550535462&sr=8-1&keywords=flow+mihaly+csikszentmihalyi) by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, or MC Flow as I like to call him.
* 5 workouts, max 5 alcoholic beverages (not during the workouts)
* Plan out a little dev project so I don’t implode into a black hole of ego

See you next week.

<br/>

A little about [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com):

[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com) is a long-form blog that attempts to explain complex topics in a way that everyone can understand.

## Chunk 2

**Chunk 2 Summary — Sept 24, 2018 - Oct 26, 2018**


* Goals missed: **2**
* Weeks complete in this chunk (my fancy measure of time): **6/6**
* Weight goal: **Down from 185 to 178**
* Participants: **37**
* Donated so far: **$365**

***

## Chunk 2 Complete
## Nov 12, 2018

I've finished this chunk, pretty much. I still have some exercises to do for the UI course, which I didn't get to in time. So, I've donated to New Story for each of you. I'm picking back up with Chunk 3 starting on Nov 26, in 2 weeks. Thanks for following, and for the encouragement!

***

## Chunk 2 - Week 6
## Starting Oct 29, 2018

Week 5 goals completed:

* [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com) week 5 complete
* [Learn UI](https://learnui.design) design course week complete
* 4 workouts done, down 3 lbs to 178 lbs
* Finished [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear

This is the final week of this chunk. I've let the homework for the design course build up, so it's going to be a busy week. Next week I'll be planning out Chunk 3.

I managed to drop 3 pounds this week, through a combination of eating less and running instead of going to the gym for each workout. Thanks JR for the motivation. This satisfies my weight goal for this chunk. Now to wrap up the two courses and move on to chunkier things.

***

## Chunk 2 - Week 5
## Starting Oct 22, 2018

Week 4 goals completed:

* [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com) week 4 complete
* [Learn UI](https://learnui.design) design course week 4 (typography) complete
* 4 workouts done, down 1 lb to 181 lbs
* Listening to: [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear

I realize there's not as much to say each week as there was in the previous chunk. But I suppose that's alright since I'm getting it done.

I just started listening to [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear. So far:

* Goals are not really worthwhile by themselves. Create systems, too. For example, this website.
* Instead of making a habit of something, become the type of person who has that habit ingrained. For example, instead
of wanting to exercise regularly, decide that you are now a person who exercises regularly. Another example: if you're
trying to quit smoking and someone offers you a cigarette, instead of saying "I'm trying to quit" say "I don't smoke".

***

## Chunk 2 - Week 4
## Starting Oct 15, 2018

Week 3 goals completed:

* [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com) week 3 complete
* [Learn UI](https://learnui.design) design course week 3 complete
* 4 workouts done, down 1 lb to 182 lbs
* Reading: [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU) by Charles Duhigg

In the design course I'm learning about colors and typography. Fascinating stuff. There are a lot of parallels between color and music, I'm finding-specifically, color has what's known as "perceived brightness", similar to how in music you manage "perceived loudness". A particular shade of blue might look really bright next to dark grey, and washed out next to bright yellow, and a guitar solo might sound shrill by itself but great with the rest of the band behind it.

I'm reading [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU) by Charles Duhigg. The big takeaways are:

1. Habits form in a particular part of our brains. Our brains optimize for making things automatic because that way we spend less energy thinking about "how do I ride a bike again?" Our brains look for certain triggers to set that automatic response in motion, so if you want to get into a habit, repeat the same steps over and over. Sure this might be what you've always heard, but I didn't know until now that there are significant neurological changes associated with building habits.
2. Habits never get 'unlearned', they just get changed. The part of your brain that is responsible for habits doesn't 'forget', so you have to either replace the response (for example, if you're trying to quit smoking the idea is to chew gum when your usual smoke-break cue fires) or to avoid the habit cues altogether.
	
I'm oversimplifying, but this is the gist. The book has a lot of interesting anecdotes, about individuals and large corporations. If that's your sort of thing, I'd recommend it.

If you're interested in the React course I'm doing, it's available now at https://advancedreact.com.

Thanks for reading!

## Chunk 2 - Week 3
## Starting Oct 8, 2018

Week 2 goals completed:

* Advanced React week 2 complete
* Learn UI design course week 2 complete
* 4 workouts done, down 1 lb to 183 lbs
	
[Design course](https://learnui.design) is still awesome, React course is also awesome. I don't have anything that interesting to share yet, but some of the upcoming homework might be interesting to share.
	
Exercise is going well, slowly but surely seeing some changes thanks to the addition of cardio and, I think, moderating alcohol consumption. I'm going to give carb reduction a shot, too.
	
Thanks for reading!

***

## Chunk 2 - Week 2
## Starting Oct 1, 2018

Welcome new folks! Thanks for being awesome: LQ, MM, MQ, AZ, SM, RG, KF, AB

Week 1 goals completed:

* Advanced React week 1 complete
* Learn UI design course week 1 complete, sort of
* 4 workouts done, down 1 lb to 184 lbs

The [design course](http://learnui.design) I'm taking is fantastic—I'm loving it. I know nothing formal about design, so it's all brand new. So far I'm learning really basic concepts and tooling for how to evaluate and build good web design. The homework got the better of me, so I missed this goal technically. I've donated $5 for each of you, and for those of you who were in the last chunk I've caught up with what I owed you for missing 2 goals.

One of the interesting aspects of the design course is that I need to pick a project that I want to work on as part of the course. I'm thinking about designing a mobile app that replicates this here accountability project. So far I think I want it to look like the inside of a DeLorean.

My weight is down 1 lbs from 185 to 184 thanks to workouts, eating sensibly (logging meals), and limiting alcohol to 5 drinks per week. Which tells you I drank more than that previously.

The React course I'm taking is really neat, too. The end result will be a fully functional e-commerce site built in React. Once that's done I'll know how to build lots of cool stuff.

For the nerds: the app will be built using [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) on the frontend, and [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) on the backend. I haven't worked with GraphQL before, and so far it's very cool.

## Chunk 2 - Week 1
## Starting Sept 24, 2018

Thanks for following along. Chunk 1 (what I’ve done so far) wasn’t completely successful in terms of the individual goals I wanted to achieve, but I can safely say it has been a tremendous success in terms of establishing habits and motivating myself with external accountability. So I’m going to continue this experiment, and add more people to increase the stakes a bit.

I have decided that I’m not going to donate to individual charities, but instead to 1. There’s no easy way to donate to 30+ charities at a time without spending a couple of hours doing it (there should be an app for that) and really I should be spending time doing other stuff. I’ll be donating to [New Story](https://newstorycharity.org). I went through Y Combinator with the founders and believe wholeheartedly in their mission: 

> "When you give to New Story, every penny of your donation goes directly to hiring locals, buying local materials, and building a home. Our private donors cover all of our operational expenses so you know the exact impact of your donation."

#### What did I get done in Chunk 1?

* established gym routine 4x/week, lost a couple of pounds, and gained a bit of muscle
* learned a bunch of programming ([Javascript](http://javascript30.com), [ES6](http://es6.io), [Node](https://learnnode.com), [React](https://reactforbeginners.com), [Redux](https://learnredux.com), [GraphQL](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react))
* learned how to better read and retain knowledge through the [Farnam Street reading course](https://fscourses.com/course/the-art-of-reading)

**I built 3 things.**

* [Vegan food options nearby, based on Yelp reviews](https://hungry.now.sh), and on [Github](https://github.com/rdyson/restaurants-nearby)
* [Quick Text Image script](https://github.com/rdyson/quick-text-image) for quickly adding text to a decent looking random image, for posting on my [@todayroblearned](https://instagram.com/todayroblearned) Instagram account
* [Bulk macOS Messages script](https://github.com/rdyson/bulk-macos-messages) for sending a message to a bunch of people from a Mac without having to send each one manually

This next chunk is shorter, just 6 weeks, and will consist of some more development learning, a course in user interface design (making apps and websites pretty and usable), and a fitness goal.

**What’s going to happen in Chunk 2?**

* Wes Bos’ [Advanced React course](https://advancedreact.com)
* [Learn UI Design course](https://learnui.design)
* Lose 6 pounds (1/week, starting weight 185 lbs)
	* regular exercise (adding cardio to weights)
	* maintaining a 2k/day calorie diet
	* limiting alcohol to 5 drinks/week
	
** What's going to happen this week**

* Week 1 of Advanced React, which includes the introduction and setup, styled components, GraphQL, and Prisma
* Week 1 of Learn UI, which is simply an introduction and getting familiar with the tools I'll be using
* 4 workouts, and the first full week of tracking what I eat

The output from the React course isn’t going to be that interesting to most of you, but I think the UI work might be. So I’ll share what I’ve done each week. I’ll also be posting my weight at the end of each week.

As before, I’d love your feedback if you have any. Think I’m approaching any of these the wrong way? Let me know. Have you seen any good courses or know of anyone who’s doing similar stuff? I’d love to hear about it.

Thanks again!

## Chunk 1 - Week 12
## Starting Sept 3, 2018

My update is late this week, and I didn’t hit my workouts goal. But I had a pretty tough cold and slept a lot. Am I off the hook? I think so.

I finished “Principles” by Ray Dalio last week and got a whole lot out of it. I need to go through it again and come up with how to personally apply his concepts (namely, deciding on my own set of principles). I can share my notes if you’re interested. And if you want me to be radically transparent/really honest with you about anything, now’s the time.

For part of this week and next week I’m out of town and will be taking a break from my goals. I’ll be starting fresh with an update on September 17, which will be the beginning of Chunk 2 of this here journey. Chunk sounds more casual and cool than “phase”, “era”, or “chapter”, right?

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 11
## Starting Aug 27, 2018

Week 10 goals completed:

* 4 workout-os
* [Reading course](https://fscourses.com/course/the-art-of-reading)

Week 11 goals to do:

* 4 workouts
* Finish reading ["Principles" by Ray Dalio](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021)

#### Some more details:

The reading course I took was really good—it presents a system for choosing the right books, deciding whether a book is worth reading, reading for retention and understanding, and reading to expand your knowledge on a given topic. Before the course I hadn't heard of the concept of 'syntopical reading', which is reading multiple sources to get a really good understanding of a topic. What the course doesn't do explicitly is teach you how to read faster, though they do suggest reading only relevant parts of a book, and rejecting some/many books altogether. I can tell you more about the course if you're interested.

So, on that note I'm going to finish reading ["Principles" by Ray Dalio](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021), the founder of [Bridgewater Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates). The book is essentially a set of work and life principles based on radical transparency and humility. Don't worry Mum, I'm not going to be (more) horrible.

No software development goals this week, that's true. Next week the UI course I want to take will be available, and the other programming course I'm waiting on may be available, too. If not, I'll have a new project to work on.

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 10
## Starting Aug 20, 2018

Week 9 goals completed:

* 4 workouts
* Project 3 (restaurants nearby) updated with all of the tacos
* Planning Chunk 2

Week 10 goals to do:

* 4 workouts
* [Reading course](https://fscourses.com/course/the-art-of-reading)

#### Some more details:

Week 9 is a lighter week—I'm on part-vacation / part-remote in Mexico City this week. I adapted my restaurants app to include restaurants here, which proved to be a bit of a challenge. I need latitude and longitude for each restaurant, which I can get for free using a service called [geocod.io](https://geocod.io), but they're U.S. only. After some digging I found [SmartyStreets](https://smartystreets.com), which is a company that offers a paid service for geocoding international addresses.

I've also started a course on improving reading comprehension. It's put together by Shane Parrish at [Farnam Street](http://fs.blog). Farnam Street publishes a great podcast called [The Knowledge Project](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project). Check it out if you might like a podcast about learning and mental models. Anyway, the reading course is designed to help improve reading, both in terms of finding the best books to read, and comprehension. My goal is to get through the course this week.

It looks as though the Advanced React course I want to take will be available next week or the week after, which will give me enough time to get that done before starting on the UI course I'm going to be using for the next chunk of weeks.

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 9
## Starting Aug 13, 2018

Week 8 goals completed:

* 4 workouts — still no weight change, but I can lift more things.
* Project 3 complete! If you're in Miami, it'll show you the nearest restaurants that have vegan options. Check it out at <a href="https://hungry.now.sh" target="_blank">hungy.now.sh</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/rdyson/restaurants-nearby" target="_blank">Github</a>. I'm not responsible for any bugs or hunger caused by this here thing. I'll take credit for all meals enjoyed with vegans, though.

Week 9 goals to do:

* 4 workouts
* Project 3 — Refine! Lots of tweaking to do to make this a bug-free and more polished app.
* Planning Chunk 2, which starts Sept 10.

#### Some more details:

I wrote an app that shows you restaurants nearby that have vegan options available. Sounds simple, right? Well, the problem I was trying to solve is that when you search for 'vegan', you get the 100% vegan restaurants first. Vegans love those places, but friends of vegans aren't necessarily as interested. So, I want to see the nearest decent restaurants that have vegan options available. I've found that the best way to find out about vegan options is to find regular (not-necessarily-vegan) restaurant reviews that mention the word 'vegan'. This app searches the reviews for you.

Before building this app, I wasn't really sure how much progress I was making in terms of learning. Now I have a much better sense of what I know and what I don't. My understanding of the technologies I'm working with isn't as solid as I thought, but I'm not too far off. One thing I know is that there are lots of vegan options that I had no clue about before. I'm excited to keep working on the app this week, making it less buggy and more presentable.

As for the workouts, I'm continuing to see progress in terms of my strength. My weight has not changed, but folks who know (thanks JS!) have assured me that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've most likely lost weight but added muscle. I'm feeling better overall, mostly because I now have a routine. I think hitting my next fitness goals will be much easier since I've established more discipline. Technically I have missed the fitness goal I wanted to hit though, so I'll be donating. Just not yet since I'm still recovering from the last batch of donations..

I had originally planned for this chunk to end after 9 weeks. However, the last course I want to take (Advanced React) isn't available yet, and the course for Chunk 2 (on UI/design) starts Sept 9, meaning I have a 3 week gap. So I'm going to work on Project 3 this week, and map out new weeks 10, 11, 12. 

Thanks for the encouragement! This has been a lot of fun.

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 8
## Starting Aug 6, 2018

Week 7 goals incomplete:

* 4 workouts — no change in weight, but hoping to see a difference this week
* Project 3 not complete

Week 8 goals to do:

* Project 3 — No change to previous description.

#### Some more details:

I didn't plan this project out at all, and ended up mid-week without having put any effort into it. Some other things came up that took priority. As a result, I have made no meaningful progress. Donations in progress.

This week I'll get it done come hell or high water. It seems like this phrase is a little lop-sided. I'm guessing high water is a flood, but isn't that always a lot less awful than hell?

Welcome JB to the fold!

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 7
## Starting July 30, 2018

So, [Sacha Baron Cohen](https://sho.com/who-is-america) is back. And I hit my goals.

* 4 workouts, increasing weight with each workout
* Project 2 complete — I wrote a script that lets me send a text message to a bunch of people at once without sending to a group. If you're reading this, you probably got a message sent using the script. It's on [Github](https://github.com/rdyson/bulk-macos-messages) in case you're interested.

Week 7 goals to do:

* Project 3 — Search Yelp reviews for a keyword, like 'vegan'. I like going to restaurants that have vegan options, but that aren't fully vegan, so I can go with omnivores and not get mauled. People with dietary restrictions might find this useful, too.
* Reduce carbohydrate intake

#### Some more details:

The project I built this past week didn't end up reinforcing any of the specific learning I've been doing, but it was a good exercise nonetheless. I could potentially turn what I built into a web or iOS app down the road.

The project I'm working on this week will include a lot of what I've been learning, including React and perhaps GraphQL.

As for the workouts, they're going very well. I'm getting stronger each week, but I'm not dropping any weight. Last week I reduced my calorie intake by 20%. This week I'm going to be eating a diet with less carbohydrates and alcohol to see if I can shed a few pounds.


***

## Chunk 1 - Week 6
## Starting July 23, 2018

Oh, hey. Week 5 goals done:

* 4 workouts and following revised nutrition plan
* [GraphQL](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react)

Week 6 goals to do:

* Project 2 — text a bunch of people at once, but not in a group message

#### Some more details:

The course I was going to be taking this week isn't ready yet, so I'm moving project 2 to this week.

For project 2 I'm going to build a tool to send a separate text message to multiple people from my phone number. What? When I text those of you on the Rob bandwagon each week, I don't want to send a group message—so I text each of you individually. There are third-party services that let you do this without having to manually create each message, but the message won't come from me, it'll come from a random number. I'm going to try to solve this problem.

As for the exercising stuff, it's going pretty well. I've reduced my calorie intake by 20%, so we'll see if that translates to any weight loss. So far my weight has not changed since week 1, but I have been eating a lot more and exercising, so that's a positive. Mmm spaghetti. I did slack on the workout schedule this week and ended up doing two on Sunday. Not going to do that again.

Thank you very much for the encouragement, especially TM, AF, JS, JD, LD.

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 5
## Starting July 16, 2018

Howdy, hello. Week 4 goals done:

* [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com)
* [Level 2 React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react)
* Hit nutrition goals daily, sort of

Week 5 goals to do:

* [GraphQL](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react)
* Hit revised nutrition goals daily

#### Some more details:

I was finding the nutrition goals I'd set up pretty difficult to hit because the calorie intake required was much higher than I'm used to eating (2400 cals/day). So I've revised my daily intake to 2000 cals/day, which is much more manageable. Along with that comes revised protein and fiber goals. I'm able to do more in my gym workouts (4x/wk) and *gasp* might actually be enjoying it.

As for development, I finished the [Level 2 React course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react), which was more about reinforcing my initial learning. There is another advanced react course on its way from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com), so I'm shuffling the weekly goals a bit. This week (Week 5) will be the [GraphQL course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react), and hopefully Week 6 will be the new course, but we'll see when it's released. I've also done away with Projects 2 and 3, as it's not feasible to get anything meaningful done and still hit my other goals. I don't count this as a miss, just as deferring to weeks 7, 8, 9 for projects.

***

## Chunk 1 - Week 4
## Starting July 9, 2018

I hope you have a fantastic week. Thanks to the new people who joined the crusade last week: MW, KW and DN. Yes, it's a crusade.

Week 3 goals done:

* [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com)
* Build Project 1: Instagram post helper
* Full steam ahead on exercise and nutrition plan

Week 4 goals to do:

* [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com)
* [Level 2 React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-2-react)
* Hit nutrition goals daily

#### Some quick details:

The exercises are getting easier, but the nutrition is proving challenging. Thanks JS for your help with this. With more meal prep I should be able to hit the nutrition goals, which are calories, fiber, and protein.

The code course I did in Week 3 (React for Beginners) was fantastic. I'm getting into some of the more challenging topics, and more of the material is applicable in real-life applications including my day job.

For my project this week I built a little tool that takes whatever text you specify and adds it to a random image, sized for sharing on Instagram. I've started a "today I learned" account where I'll share random stuff that I've discovered. Some obvious, some not. In case you're interested, the project is on [Github](https://github.com/rdyson/quick-text-image) and the Instagram account is [@todayroblearned](https://instagram.com/todayroblearned).

## Chunk 1 -Week 3
## Starting July 2, 2018

I hope you had an awesome week and weekend. I managed to get my Week 2 goals done, but again, cutting it pretty close. Thanks for the support! 

Week 2 goals done:

* Node course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com))
* Start exercise plan (4x/week) and nutrition plan
* Map out projects for coming weeks, to reinforce programming learning

Week 3 goals to do:

* [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com)
* Build Project 1: Instagram post helper
* Full steam ahead on exercise and nutrition plan

#### Some more details, about exercise:

This past week I hit the goal of exercising 4x by doing all the exercises in the Devlifts plan I've described previously. I counted this past week as sort of a warm-up week—I wanted to see if I could actually *do* the exercises, and figure out what equipment does what at the gym, who to avoid, who the nice kids are, etc. Turns out the exercises are all simple despite their dinosaur-sounding names. I'm rather sore. Big thanks to JS for your coaching!

As for the nutrition part, I tried one version of the nutrition plan that was slightly more challenging, and have decided to go the easier route, at least for now. The challenging part would have involved some keto, which is very limiting for us vegan folk. So I'm doing a (still challenging) macro nutrition plan.

If you're interested in seeing the plan, message me and I'll send it over.


#### and development 

I made the same mistake in Week 2 as I did in Week 1. I totaled all the course video times and assumed it would take me about that long to complete the goal, but I ended up taking twice as long—working out issues and reviewing (and re-reviewing) some of the more challenging concepts. The course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com)) was really great. Fast-paced like the first one, and I ended up with a usable app that lets you find and rate restaurants in your area. I may use this as a start to one of my future projects. I'm thinking about putting together a site that pulls listings in from Yelp and filters by vegan *and* non-vegan friendliness—so, a restaurant where carnivores and herbivores will be equally happy.


#### and the Week 3 project - Instagram post helper

For my project this week I'm going to build a tool that automates parts or all of the process of posting text to Instagram. I'm starting an account to post the 'today I learned' things. Random stuff I didn't know that I learn each day (you'll get a follow request soon enough). Some things will be interesting, others will be things everyone else knew already. The idea is I'd like to be able to type in "Today I learned: Lemmings actually don't kill themselves, Disney does." ([true story](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56)) and hit 'post'. I'd automatically pull in a background, lay out the text, and perhaps add a link in the comments to more information. That's the idea—I'll see how far I can get based on what Instagram allows.


***

## Chunk 1 - Week 2
## Starting June 25, 2018

One week down, 8 to go in Chunk 1. I cut it pretty close to the deadline, but managed to finish everything by the end of the week. I had estimated it would take approximately 15 hours to get through the two courses for Week 1, based on the duration of the videos in the courses. I had not anticipated spending quite a bit more time on a few videos involving the more complicated topics. Rookie/Week 1 mistake.

Week 1 goals done:

* Core JavaScript courses (ES6)
  * [Javascript 30](http://javascript30.com)
  * [ES6 for Everyone](http://es6.io)
* Set up website at rdyson.co, tweak
* Exercise 4x
* Plan Week 2 exercise goals

Week 2 goals to do:

* Node course ([Learn Node](https://learnnode.com))
* Start exercise plan (4x/week) and nutrition plan
* Map out projects for coming weeks, to reinforce programming learning

#### Some more details, about exercise:

I've signed up for [Devlifts](https://devlifts.io)—they put together health and fitness plans for...developers. You tell them your goals and go through a questionnaire, and they get back to you with a detailed exercise plan and a recommended nutrition plan. My plan consists of 4 weight-lifting days and light cardio days, targets for fiber, protein, and carbohydrates, and supplements. Check them out if this sounds good to you, and you're a developer.

#### and development:

I decided on these JavaScript courses after listening to a development podcast called [Syntax](http://syntax.fm) (thanks AF for the recommendation). The podcast is hosted by two developers who have created online courses about JavaScript and various other topics. Initially I was skeptical about the quality of the courses—some are free, others are included in a very low monthly subscription price. I was convinced after listening to most of the Syntax back catalog that these guys know what they're talking about, and have both built their businesses on referrals. I'm really impressed with the quality of the course content, and enjoy the teaching style—fast-paced short (10-20 minute) videos illustrating concepts with examples. Anything especially complex is broken down into 2-3 videos. Check them out if you're interested in learning or brushing up on anything JavaScript-related. The hosts of the show are [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com) and Scott Tolinski who has courses at [Level Up Tutorials](http://leveluptutorials.com).

## Chunk 1 -Week 1
## Starting June 18, 2018 

Here are the details, in case you're curious. I have two big goals to hit by the end of 2018: 

1. Become a much better software developer, and 
2. Get in really good shape. 

I'm dividing the rest of the year into 3 chunks of 9 weeks, with the last week of December off.

Becoming a much better software developer means getting awesome at JavaScript and a JavaScript library called React (my current expertise is in older technologies), getting great at design (user experience and interfaces for websites and apps), and getting much more familiar with the business aspects of running a startup. For each of these areas I have online courses and coaching mapped out, and will be reinforcing my learning with projects that I will share. The rough outline for the first chunk of 9 weeks, where I'll be focusing on improving my programming skills, is as follows:

Chunk 1 — JavaScript and React (9 weeks, starting June 18 and ending August 19)

* Week 1: Core JavaScript / Set up website at rdyson.co (this site, improved)
* Week 2: Node / Map out projects
* Week 3: React / Project 1
* Week 4: Advanced React / Project 1
* Week 5: Advanced React / Project 2
* Week 6: GraphQL / Project 3
* Weeks 7, 8, 9: Project 4 (The Big Kahuna)

Chunk 2 — Design UX/UI (9 weeks, starting August 20 and ending October 21)

Chunk 3 — Startup business skills (9 weeks, starting October 22 and ending December 23)

As for my goal of getting in really good shape, I'm working with a trainer to develop specific exercise and nutrition goals. At a high level, I want to exercise 4x/week and get down to 170 lbs from my current 185 lbs in the next 9 weeks (about 1.5 lbs/week). The goal for Week 1 is to exercise 4 times and to eat no fries (the hardest part of this entire mission). I'll have more specific goals for Week 2.

Each Monday I'll update you (and this page) with my progress. If I miss a goal I'll donate another $5.

Thank you again for your help! If you have any feedback or advice, I'm more than open to it. And if you have anything you want help with, please let me know. I'd love to give you a hand.

Rob

---

1. Some of the charities require a minimum donation greater than $5. I'll let each of you know individually about your donation.
2. Why is this number not participants*5? There are a few reasons. 1) As described above, some charities have a minimum donation greater than $5. 2) A couple of the charities are in the UK, so I donated 5 GBP. 3) Some people haven't specified an organization yet.
