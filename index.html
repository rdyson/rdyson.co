# Howdy! Hello World. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ¤“ 

## Week 1 - Starting June 18, 2018 

**Thanks for helping me out with my goals. You're awesome. To start, I've donated $5 to your chosen organization or charity<sup>1</sup>. If I miss a weekly goal, I'll donate another $5.**

* Participants: **25**
* Donated so far: **$116.87**<sup>2</sup>
* Goals missed: **0**

***

Here are the details, in case you're curious. I have two big goals to hit by the end of 2018: 

1. Become a much better startup software developer, and 
2. Get in really good shape. 

I'm dividing the rest of the year into 3 chunks of 9 weeks, with the last week of December off.

Becoming a much better startup software developer means getting awesome at JavaScript and a JavaScript library called React (my current expertise is in older technologies), getting great at design (user experience and interfaces for websites and apps), and getting better at the business aspects of running a startup. For each of these areas I have online courses and coaching mapped out, and will be reinforcing my learning with projects that I will share. The rough outline for the first chunk of 9 weeks, where I'll be focusing on improving my programming skills, is as follows:

Chunk 1 â€” JavaScript and React (9 weeks, starting June 18 and ending August 19)

* Week 1: ES6 and JS 30 / Set up website at rdyson.co (this site, improved)
* Week 2: Node / Map out projects
* Week 3: React / Project 1
* Week 4: Advanced React / Project 1
* Week 5: Advanced React / Project 2
* Week 6: GraphQL / Project 3
* Week 7, 8, 9: Project 4 (The Big Kahuna)

Chunk 2 â€” Design UX/UI (9 weeks, starting August 20 and ending October 21)

Chunk 3 â€”Â Startup business (9 weeks, starting October 22 and ending December 23)

As for my goal of getting in really good shape, I'm working with a trainer to develop specific exercise and nutrition goals. At a high level, I want to exercise 4x/week and get down to 170 lbs from my current 185 lbs in the next 9 weeks (about 1.5 lbs/week). The goal for Week 1 is to exercise 4 times and to eat no fries (the hardest part of this entire mission). I'll have more specific goals for Week 2.

Each Monday, I'll update you (and this page) with my progress. If I miss a goal, I'll donate another $5.

Thank you again for your help! If you have any feedback or advice, I'm more than open to it. And if you have anything you want help with, please let me know. I'd love to give you a hand.

---

1. Some of the charities require a minimum greater than $5. I'll let each of you know individually about your donation.
2. Why is this number not 25*5? There are a few reasons. 1) As described above, some charities have a minimum donation greater than $5. 2) A couple of the charities are in the UK, so I donated 5 GBP. 3) Some people haven't specified an organization yet.
